## **Code Lab Project: News Homepage**

As part of my certification program with ***[Code Lab](https://www.facebook.com/codelab.mm)***, I was tasked with creating a mobile fully responsive website using only HTML and CSS. My tutor provided me with this challenge, and I found a reference design on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl).

While I tried my best to make the website responsive, I had not yet learned JavaScript, so I skipped the mobile menu for now. Nevertheless, this project helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills, and I'm proud of the result.
